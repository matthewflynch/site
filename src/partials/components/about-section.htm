                        <h3>I curate experiences to acheive impact.</h3>
                        <p>I am naturally curious as a person. I tend to find myself looking for the unique in situations and figuring out how it compliments the average. I am a tinkerer by nature, with a playful eye for all that is mundane. My experiences and opportunities have brought me to work in four countries, multiple sectors and various roles. I have enjoyed the opportunity of looking at community development with the perspective of a business person and looking at business through the lens of a community developer. The assets and positive attributes from the two worlds deserve to be collided and I have constantly sought on how to bridge the social inclusion of community development and the success-driven sustainability of business into a single equation. 

                            I have a track record of being able to: 
                            
                            Working in gray space to create something with long-term potential
                            
                            Building and executing strong strategy for sustainability 
                            
                            Using my design thinking skills to strengthen the quality of programming 
                            
                            Facilitating groups of adult learners to build skill, knowledge, or consensus
                            
                            When I’m not in the professional setting, I tend to find myself staring up at the sky dreaming, burning my partner’s dinner or getting lost in someone else’s perspective. If I’m no where to be found there, then I’m most likely dancing off beat or getting lost in a city unbeknown to me. I’m continually looking for a place where I can grow what I do well and learn how little I truly know about it all.
